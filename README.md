# Oasis-Infobyte-Internship


This internship was all about data science and analytics. I applied for this internship from the website of Oasis Infobyte. I completed all the given tasks by them. They have given 5 tasks. The description of all the tasks is given below:

Task-1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION I predicted the species of IRIS Flower using the attributes given such as: petal length, sepal length, petal width and sepal width. I used Decision Tree classification(ID3 Classifier) for classification of species.

TASK-3 CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the good will of the brand of the car, features of the car, horoscope and the milage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

Task-4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION We have all been the recipient of spam mails before. Spam mail,or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams ,or most dangerously, phishing content. In this project , we use Python to build an email spam detector. Then use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
